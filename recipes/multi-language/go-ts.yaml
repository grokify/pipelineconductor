# Multi-language recipe: Go + TypeScript
#
# For repos with both Go and TypeScript code, create separate workflow files
# for each language. This allows path-based filtering so only relevant CI
# runs when files change.
#
# Required files in .github/workflows/:
#   - go-ci.yaml    (copy from recipes/go/go-ci.yaml)
#   - go-lint.yaml  (copy from recipes/go/go-lint.yaml)
#   - ts-ci.yaml    (copy from recipes/ts/ts-ci.yaml)
#   - ts-lint.yaml  (copy from recipes/ts/ts-lint.yaml)
#
# For repos with TypeScript in a subdirectory (e.g., ts/), add working-directory:
#
#   jobs:
#     ci:
#       uses: grokify/.github/.github/workflows/ts-ci.yaml@main
#       with:
#         working-directory: 'ts'
#
# Example: github.com/grokify/echartify
#   - Go code in root (chartir/, schema/)
#   - TypeScript in ts/ subdirectory
#
# Pipelineconductor detection:
#   - Has go-ci.yaml AND ts-ci.yaml = multi-language repo
#   - Query: repos with both Go and TypeScript
